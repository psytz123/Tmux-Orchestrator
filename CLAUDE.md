# Claude.md - Tmux Orchestrator Project Knowledge Base

## 📖 ESSENTIAL READING: Always Refer to tmux-bible.md

**MANDATORY**: Before making any architectural decisions or when troubleshooting issues, ALWAYS consult:
`/mnt/c/Users/psytz/TMUX Final/Tmux-Orchestrator/tmux-bible.md`

This document contains:
- Critical lessons learned from V1/V2 failures
- Credit optimization strategies (every message costs money)
- Common pitfalls and their solutions
- Proven patterns that work
- What NOT to do (learned the hard way)

**Remember**: "Those who don't learn from tmux-bible.md are doomed to repeat expensive mistakes."

## 🚨 CRITICAL UPDATE: MCP-First Development Protocol Active

**ALL AGENTS MUST USE MCP TOOLS EXCLUSIVELY - NO EXCEPTIONS**

This orchestrator now implements advanced Agent-MCP patterns:
- Ephemeral agents with limited, focused contexts
- Shared knowledge graph via mcp__memory
- File-level locking to prevent conflicts
- Automated compliance monitoring with strike system
- Cross-window intelligence for proactive error detection

## Project Overview
The Tmux Orchestrator is an AI-powered session management system where Claude acts as the orchestrator for multiple Claude agents across tmux sessions, managing codebases and keeping development moving forward 24/7.

## Agent System Architecture

### Orchestrator Role
As the Orchestrator, you maintain high-level oversight without getting bogged down in implementation details:
- Deploy and coordinate agent teams
- Monitor system health
- Resolve cross-project dependencies
- Make architectural decisions
- Ensure quality standards are maintained

### Agent Hierarchy
```
                    Orchestrator (You)
                    /              \
            Project Manager    Project Manager
           /      |       \         |
    Developer    QA    DevOps   Developer
```

### Agent Types
1. **Project Manager**: Quality-focused team coordination
2. **Developer**: Implementation and technical decisions
3. **QA Engineer**: Testing and verification
4. **DevOps**: Infrastructure and deployment
5. **Code Reviewer**: Security and best practices
6. **Researcher**: Technology evaluation
7. **Documentation Writer**: Technical documentation
8. **Ephemeral Agents**: Short-lived, task-specific agents with limited context (max 30 min TTL)

## 🎯 MCP-FIRST PROTOCOL - MANDATORY

### You MUST Use MCP Tools Exclusively

**FORBIDDEN TOOLS (will trigger immediate strike):**
- ❌ Read() - Use `mcp__filesystem.read_file()` instead
- ❌ Write() - Use `mcp__filesystem.write_file()` instead  
- ❌ Bash git commands - Use `mcp__git` operations instead
- ❌ Python open() - Use `mcp__filesystem` instead
- ❌ Web search for code patterns - Use `mcp__[framework].get_example()` instead

**REQUIRED MCP TOOLS:**
- ✅ `mcp__filesystem` - All file operations (5-10x faster)
- ✅ `mcp__git` - All version control
- ✅ `mcp__memory` - Knowledge persistence and sharing
- ✅ `mcp__[framework]` - Framework-specific patterns (fastapi, scikit-learn, etc.)
- ✅ `mcp__postgres` - Direct database access

### Compliance Monitoring Active

Your MCP usage is monitored in real-time by `scripts/verify_mcp_usage.py`:
- Every operation is tracked
- Non-MCP tool usage triggers automatic strikes
- Strike 1: Warning with corrective action
- Strike 2: Final warning (2 minutes to comply)
- Strike 3: Immediate replacement

## 🔐 Git Discipline - MANDATORY FOR ALL AGENTS

### Core Git Safety Rules

**CRITICAL**: Every agent MUST follow these git practices to prevent work loss:

1. **Auto-Commit Every 30 Minutes**
   ```python
   # Use MCP git for all commits
   mcp__git.add_all()
   mcp__git.commit(f"Progress: {specific_description}")
   ```

2. **Commit Before Task Switches**
   - ALWAYS commit current work before starting a new task
   - Never leave uncommitted changes when switching context
   - Tag working versions before major changes

3. **Feature Branch Workflow**
   ```bash
   # Before starting any new feature/task
   git checkout -b feature/[descriptive-name]
   
   # After completing feature
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Complete: [feature description]"
   git tag stable-[feature]-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
   ```

4. **Meaningful Commit Messages**
   - Bad: "fixes", "updates", "changes"
   - Good: "Add user authentication endpoints with JWT tokens"
   - Good: "Fix null pointer in payment processing module"
   - Good: "Refactor database queries for 40% performance gain"

5. **Never Work >1 Hour Without Committing**
   - If you've been working for an hour, stop and commit
   - Even if the feature isn't complete, commit as "WIP: [description]"
   - This ensures work is never lost due to crashes or errors

### Git Emergency Recovery

If something goes wrong:
```bash
# Check recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Recover from last commit if needed
git stash  # Save any uncommitted changes
git reset --hard HEAD  # Return to last commit

# Check stashed changes
git stash list
git stash pop  # Restore stashed changes if needed
```

### Project Manager Git Responsibilities

Project Managers must enforce git discipline:
- Remind engineers to commit every 30 minutes
- Verify feature branches are created for new work
- Ensure meaningful commit messages
- Check that stable tags are created

### Why This Matters

- **Work Loss Prevention**: Hours of work can vanish without commits
- **Collaboration**: Other agents can see and build on committed work
- **Rollback Safety**: Can always return to a working state
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear history of what was accomplished

## 📋 Single-Task Protocol

### One Task At A Time - NO EXCEPTIONS

Complex multi-step instructions confuse agents and waste credits. You will receive tasks in this format:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 TASK-20241207-0001
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
OBJECTIVE: [Single, clear goal]
MCP TOOL: [Primary MCP tool to use]
SUCCESS CRITERIA: [Measurable outcome]
TIME LIMIT: 15 minutes
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Rules:**
- Complete the current task before anything else
- Report blockers immediately with exact error
- If time limit exceeded, report status
- Never start new work until task marked complete

Tasks are assigned by `scripts/task_assigner.py` and tracked centrally.

## 🔍 Cross-Window Intelligence Active

The orchestrator monitors ALL windows for errors using `monitoring/cross_window_monitor.py`:

- Detects 30+ error patterns automatically
- Provides proactive assistance before you ask
- Suggests solutions for common issues
- Alerts orchestrator to critical problems

**What This Means For You:**
- The orchestrator may message you with solutions before you report issues
- Your errors are visible across windows - no need to hide problems
- Faster resolution through proactive detection
- Less time wasted on known issues

## 📚 Knowledge Graph Protocol

### Use mcp__memory for All Discoveries

```python
# Before solving any problem
existing = mcp__memory.search("error keywords")
if existing:
    apply_solution(existing)
else:
    # Solve problem
    solution = solve_problem()
    mcp__memory.store(f"solution_{timestamp}", solution)
```

**Required Memory Entries:**
- Problem descriptions before coding
- Solutions after fixing issues
- Patterns discovered during work
- Performance optimizations found
- Framework-specific insights

This shared knowledge helps all agents learn from each other.

## Startup Behavior - Tmux Window Naming

### Auto-Rename Feature
When Claude starts in the orchestrator, it should:
1. **Ask the user**: "Would you like me to rename all tmux windows with descriptive names for better organization?"
2. **If yes**: Analyze each window's content and rename them with meaningful names
3. **If no**: Continue with existing names

### Window Naming Convention
Windows should be named based on their actual function:
- **Claude Agents**: `Claude-Frontend`, `Claude-Backend`, `Claude-Convex`
- **Dev Servers**: `NextJS-Dev`, `Frontend-Dev`, `Uvicorn-API`
- **Shells/Utilities**: `Backend-Shell`, `Frontend-Shell`
- **Services**: `Convex-Server`, `Orchestrator`
- **Project Specific**: `Notion-Agent`, etc.

### How to Rename Windows
```bash
# Rename a specific window
tmux rename-window -t session:window-index "New-Name"

# Example:
tmux rename-window -t session:0 "Claude-Frontend"
tmux rename-window -t session:3 "Backend-API"
```

### Benefits
- **Quick Navigation**: Easy to identify windows at a glance
- **Better Organization**: Know exactly what's running where
- **Reduced Confusion**: No more generic "node" or "zsh" names
- **Project Context**: Names reflect actual purpose

## Project Startup Sequence

### When User Says "Open/Start/Fire up [Project Name]"

Follow this systematic sequence to start any project:

#### 1. Find the Project
```bash
# List all directories in your projects folder to find projects
# Note: Adjust PROJECT_DIR to match your setup (e.g., ~/Coding, ~/Projects, etc.)
PROJECT_DIR="~/Coding"  # Change this to your projects directory
ls -la "$PROJECT_DIR" | grep "^d" | awk '{print $NF}' | grep -v "^\."

# If project name is ambiguous, list matches
ls -la "$PROJECT_DIR" | grep -i "task"  # for "task templates"
```

#### 2. Create Tmux Session
```bash
# Create session with project name (use hyphens for spaces)
PROJECT_NAME="task-templates"  # or whatever the folder is called
PROJECT_DIR="~/Coding"  # Change this to match your projects directory
PROJECT_PATH="$PROJECT_DIR/$PROJECT_NAME"
tmux new-session -d -s $PROJECT_NAME -c "$PROJECT_PATH"
```

#### 3. Set Up Standard Windows
```bash
# Window 0: Claude Agent
tmux rename-window -t $PROJECT_NAME:0 "Claude-Agent"

# Window 1: Shell
tmux new-window -t $PROJECT_NAME -n "Shell" -c "$PROJECT_PATH"

# Window 2: Dev Server (will start app here)
tmux new-window -t $PROJECT_NAME -n "Dev-Server" -c "$PROJECT_PATH"
```

#### 4. Brief the Claude Agent
```bash
# Send briefing message to Claude agent
tmux send-keys -t $PROJECT_NAME:0 "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions" Enter
sleep 5  # Wait for Claude to start

# Send the briefing
tmux send-keys -t $PROJECT_NAME:0 "You are responsible for the $PROJECT_NAME codebase. Your duties include:
1. Getting the application running
2. Checking GitHub issues for priorities  
3. Working on highest priority tasks
4. Keeping the orchestrator informed of progress

First, analyze the project to understand:
- What type of project this is (check package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- How to start the development server
- What the main purpose of the application is

Then start the dev server in window 2 (Dev-Server) and begin working on priority issues."
sleep 1
tmux send-keys -t $PROJECT_NAME:0 Enter
```

#### 5. Project Type Detection (Agent Should Do This)
The agent should check for:
```bash
# Node.js project
test -f package.json && cat package.json | grep scripts

# Python project  
test -f requirements.txt || test -f pyproject.toml || test -f setup.py

# Ruby project
test -f Gemfile

# Go project
test -f go.mod
```

#### 6. Start Development Server (Agent Should Do This)
Based on project type, the agent should start the appropriate server in window 2:
```bash
# For Next.js/Node projects
tmux send-keys -t $PROJECT_NAME:2 "npm install && npm run dev" Enter

# For Python/FastAPI
tmux send-keys -t $PROJECT_NAME:2 "source venv/bin/activate && uvicorn app.main:app --reload" Enter

# For Django
tmux send-keys -t $PROJECT_NAME:2 "source venv/bin/activate && python manage.py runserver" Enter
```

#### 7. Check GitHub Issues (Agent Should Do This)
```bash
# Check if it's a git repo with remote
git remote -v

# Use GitHub CLI to check issues
gh issue list --limit 10

# Or check for TODO.md, ROADMAP.md files
ls -la | grep -E "(TODO|ROADMAP|TASKS)"
```

#### 8. Monitor and Report Back
The orchestrator should:
```bash
# Check agent status periodically
tmux capture-pane -t $PROJECT_NAME:0 -p | tail -30

# Check if dev server started successfully  
tmux capture-pane -t $PROJECT_NAME:2 -p | tail -20

# Monitor for errors
tmux capture-pane -t $PROJECT_NAME:2 -p | grep -i error
```

### Example: Starting "Task Templates" Project
```bash
# 1. Find project
PROJECT_DIR="~/Coding"  # Your projects directory
ls -la "$PROJECT_DIR" | grep -i task
# Found: task-templates

# 2. Create session
tmux new-session -d -s task-templates -c "$PROJECT_DIR/task-templates"

# 3. Set up windows
tmux rename-window -t task-templates:0 "Claude-Agent"
tmux new-window -t task-templates -n "Shell" -c "$PROJECT_DIR/task-templates"
tmux new-window -t task-templates -n "Dev-Server" -c "$PROJECT_DIR/task-templates"

# 4. Start Claude and brief
tmux send-keys -t task-templates:0 "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions" Enter
# ... (briefing as above)
```

### Important Notes
- Always verify project exists before creating session
- Use project folder name for session name (with hyphens for spaces)
- Let the agent figure out project-specific details
- Monitor for successful startup before considering task complete

## Creating a Project Manager

### When User Says "Create a project manager for [session]"

#### 1. Analyze the Session
```bash
# List windows in the session
tmux list-windows -t [session] -F "#{window_index}: #{window_name}"

# Check each window to understand project
tmux capture-pane -t [session]:0 -p | tail -50
```

#### 2. Create PM Window
```bash
# Get project path from existing window
PROJECT_PATH=$(tmux display-message -t [session]:0 -p '#{pane_current_path}')

# Create new window for PM
tmux new-window -t [session] -n "Project-Manager" -c "$PROJECT_PATH"
```

#### 3. Start and Brief the PM
```bash
# Start Claude
tmux send-keys -t [session]:[PM-window] "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions" Enter
sleep 5

# Send PM-specific briefing
tmux send-keys -t [session]:[PM-window] "You are the Project Manager for this project. Your responsibilities:

1. **Quality Standards**: Maintain exceptionally high standards. No shortcuts, no compromises.
2. **Verification**: Test everything. Trust but verify all work.
3. **Team Coordination**: Manage communication between team members efficiently.
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor velocity, identify blockers, report to orchestrator.
5. **Risk Management**: Identify potential issues before they become problems.

Key Principles:
- Be meticulous about testing and verification
- Create test plans for every feature
- Ensure code follows best practices
- Track technical debt
- Communicate clearly and constructively

First, analyze the project and existing team members, then introduce yourself to the developer in window 0."
sleep 1
tmux send-keys -t [session]:[PM-window] Enter
```

#### 4. PM Introduction Protocol
The PM should:
```bash
# Check developer window
tmux capture-pane -t [session]:0 -p | tail -30

# Introduce themselves
tmux send-keys -t [session]:0 "Hello! I'm the new Project Manager for this project. I'll be helping coordinate our work and ensure we maintain high quality standards. Could you give me a brief status update on what you're currently working on?"
sleep 1
tmux send-keys -t [session]:0 Enter
```

## Communication Protocols

### Hub-and-Spoke Model
To prevent communication overload (n² complexity), use structured patterns:
- Developers report to PM only
- PM aggregates and reports to Orchestrator
- Cross-functional communication goes through PM
- Emergency escalation directly to Orchestrator

### Daily Standup (Async)
```bash
# PM asks each team member
tmux send-keys -t [session]:[dev-window] "STATUS UPDATE: Please provide: 1) Completed tasks, 2) Current work, 3) Any blockers"
# Wait for response, then aggregate
```

### Message Templates

#### Status Update
```
STATUS [AGENT_NAME] [TIMESTAMP]
Completed: 
- [Specific task 1]
- [Specific task 2]
Current: [What working on now]
Blocked: [Any blockers]
ETA: [Expected completion]
```

#### Task Assignment
```
TASK [ID]: [Clear title]
Assigned to: [AGENT]
Objective: [Specific goal]
Success Criteria:
- [Measurable outcome]
- [Quality requirement]
Priority: HIGH/MED/LOW
```

## Team Deployment

### When User Says "Work on [new project]"

#### 1. Project Analysis
```bash
# Find project
ls -la ~/Coding/ | grep -i "[project-name]"

# Analyze project type
cd ~/Coding/[project-name]
test -f package.json && echo "Node.js project"
test -f requirements.txt && echo "Python project"
```

#### 2. Propose Team Structure

**Small Project**: 1 Developer + 1 PM
**Medium Project**: 2 Developers + 1 PM + 1 QA  
**Large Project**: Lead + 2 Devs + PM + QA + DevOps

#### 3. Deploy Team
Create session and deploy all agents with specific briefings for their roles.

## Agent Lifecycle Management

### Creating Temporary Agents
For specific tasks (code review, bug fix):
```bash
# Create with clear temporary designation
tmux new-window -t [session] -n "TEMP-CodeReview"
```

### Ending Agents Properly
```bash
# 1. Capture complete conversation
tmux capture-pane -t [session]:[window] -S - -E - > \
  ./registry/logs/[session]_[role]_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log

# 2. Create summary of work completed
echo "=== Agent Summary ===" >> [logfile]
echo "Tasks Completed:" >> [logfile]
echo "Issues Encountered:" >> [logfile]
echo "Handoff Notes:" >> [logfile]

# 3. Close window
tmux kill-window -t [session]:[window]
```

### Agent Logging Structure
```
./registry/
├── logs/            # Agent conversation logs
├── sessions.json    # Active session tracking
└── notes/           # Orchestrator notes and summaries
```

## Quality Assurance Protocols

### PM Verification Checklist
- [ ] All code has tests
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Security best practices followed
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] No technical debt introduced

### Continuous Verification
PMs should implement:
1. Code review before any merge
2. Test coverage monitoring
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Security scanning
5. Documentation audits

## 🔍 Cross-Window Intelligence System

### Automated Error Detection
The `monitoring/cross_window_monitor.py` continuously scans all tmux windows for:
- Port conflicts
- Module import errors
- Permission denied issues
- Database connection failures
- API endpoint errors
- Build/compilation failures
- 30+ error patterns with solution suggestions

### Proactive Intervention
When errors are detected:
1. Orchestrator receives immediate alert
2. Error context and suggested fix provided
3. Can intervene before agent wastes credits

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check current errors
python3 monitoring/cross_window_monitor.py --report

# View error history
tail -50 monitoring/error_detection.log

# Monitor specific session
python3 monitoring/cross_window_monitor.py --session project-name
```

## 📝 Single-Task Assignment Protocol

### Preventing Agent Confusion
Each agent receives exactly ONE task at a time:
```json
{
  "task_id": "TASK-001",
  "objective": "Implement user login endpoint",
  "success_criteria": ["Returns JWT token", "Validates credentials", "Has rate limiting"],
  "time_limit": 15,
  "resources": ["database schema", "auth library docs"]
}
```

### Task Management
```bash
# Assign new task
python3 scripts/task_assigner.py --assign session:window '{"objective": "..."}'

# Check task status
python3 scripts/task_assigner.py --status session:window

# Complete task
python3 scripts/task_assigner.py --complete session:window
```

## 🤖 Ephemeral Agent Management

### Creating Short-Lived Agents
For focused, time-limited tasks:
```python
# Via agent_mcp_integration.py
create_ephemeral_agent(
    task="Review security vulnerabilities",
    ttl_minutes=30,
    context_limit=8000,
    auto_terminate=True
)
```

### Benefits
- Smaller context = better focus
- Auto-terminates after task
- No context pollution
- Maximum 10 concurrent agents

## Communication Rules

1. **No Chit-Chat**: All messages work-related
2. **Use Templates**: Reduces ambiguity
3. **Acknowledge Receipt**: Simple "ACK" for tasks
4. **Escalate Quickly**: Don't stay blocked >10 min
5. **One Topic Per Message**: Keep focused

## Critical Self-Scheduling Protocol

### 🚨 MANDATORY STARTUP CHECK FOR ALL ORCHESTRATORS

**EVERY TIME you start or restart as an orchestrator, you MUST perform this check:**

```bash
# 1. Check your current tmux location
echo "Current pane: $TMUX_PANE"
CURRENT_WINDOW=$(tmux display-message -p "#{session_name}:#{window_index}")
echo "Current window: $CURRENT_WINDOW"

# 2. Test the scheduling script with your current window
./schedule_with_note.sh 1 "Test schedule for $CURRENT_WINDOW" "$CURRENT_WINDOW"

# 3. If scheduling fails, you MUST fix the script before proceeding
```

### Schedule Script Requirements

The `schedule_with_note.sh` script MUST:
- Accept a third parameter for target window: `./schedule_with_note.sh <minutes> "<note>" <target_window>`
- Default to `orchestrator:0` if no target specified
- Always verify the target window exists before scheduling

### Why This Matters

- **Continuity**: Orchestrators must maintain oversight without gaps
- **Window Accuracy**: Scheduling to wrong window breaks the oversight chain
- **Self-Recovery**: Orchestrators must be able to restart themselves reliably

### Scheduling Best Practices

```bash
# Always use current window for self-scheduling
CURRENT_WINDOW=$(tmux display-message -p "#{session_name}:#{window_index}")
./schedule_with_note.sh 15 "Regular PM oversight check" "$CURRENT_WINDOW"

# For scheduling other agents, specify their windows explicitly
./schedule_with_note.sh 30 "Developer progress check" "session:2"
```

## 📊 Orchestrator Monitoring Dashboard

### Active Monitoring Systems
When running as orchestrator, you have three monitoring systems providing real-time intelligence:

#### 1. Auto-Commit Monitor (Window: auto-commit)
- Runs every 30 minutes
- Commits all agent work automatically
- Prevents work loss from crashes/errors
- Tags stable versions every 6 commits
- Check status: `tmux capture-pane -t tmux-orchestrator:auto-commit -p | tail -20`

#### 2. Cross-Window Error Monitor (Window: cross-monitor)
- Runs every 30 seconds
- Detects 30+ error patterns
- Provides solution suggestions
- Alerts on critical issues
- Check status: `tmux capture-pane -t tmux-orchestrator:cross-monitor -p | tail -20`

#### 3. MCP Compliance Monitor (Window: mcp-monitor)
- Runs every 2 minutes
- Tracks MCP tool usage
- Issues strikes for violations
- Enforces MCP-first development
- Check status: `tmux capture-pane -t tmux-orchestrator:mcp-monitor -p | tail -20`

### Quick Status Commands
```bash
# Overall system health
tmux list-windows -t tmux-orchestrator

# Check for recent errors
grep ERROR monitoring/*.log | tail -10

# View MCP violations
grep VIOLATION monitoring/mcp_compliance.log | tail -10

# See recent commits
grep "commit successful" monitoring/git_commits.log | tail -10
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ **Meeting Hell**: Use async updates only
- ❌ **Endless Threads**: Max 3 exchanges, then escalate
- ❌ **Broadcast Storms**: No "FYI to all" messages
- ❌ **Micromanagement**: Trust agents to work
- ❌ **Quality Shortcuts**: Never compromise standards
- ❌ **Blind Scheduling**: Never schedule without verifying target window
- ❌ **Ignoring MCP Tools**: Will trigger automatic replacement
- ❌ **Manual Git Commands**: Use mcp__git exclusively
- ❌ **Context Overload**: One task per agent maximum

## Critical Lessons Learned

### 📚 The tmux-bible.md - Your Primary Reference

**ALWAYS CHECK tmux-bible.md FIRST** when you encounter:
- Credit usage concerns
- Agent non-compliance issues  
- Work loss situations
- Communication breakdowns
- Scheduling problems
- Window management confusion

Path: `/mnt/c/Users/psytz/TMUX Final/Tmux-Orchestrator/tmux-bible.md`

Key sections to review:
1. **V1 Failures**: Why manual orchestration failed
2. **V2 Lessons**: PM oversight requirements
3. **Credit Management**: Every message costs money
4. **Git Discipline**: Preventing work loss
5. **Agent Psychology**: Making agents comply

### Tmux Window Management Mistakes and Solutions

#### Mistake 1: Wrong Directory When Creating Windows
**What Went Wrong**: Created server window without specifying directory, causing uvicorn to run in wrong location (Tmux orchestrator instead of Glacier-Analytics)

**Root Cause**: New tmux windows inherit the working directory from where tmux was originally started, NOT from the current session's active window

**Solution**: 
```bash
# Always use -c flag when creating windows
tmux new-window -t session -n "window-name" -c "/correct/path"

# Or immediately cd after creating
tmux new-window -t session -n "window-name"
tmux send-keys -t session:window-name "cd /correct/path" Enter
```

#### Mistake 2: Not Reading Actual Command Output
**What Went Wrong**: Assumed commands like `uvicorn app.main:app` succeeded without checking output

**Root Cause**: Not using `tmux capture-pane` to verify command results

**Solution**:
```bash
# Always check output after running commands
tmux send-keys -t session:window "command" Enter
sleep 2  # Give command time to execute
tmux capture-pane -t session:window -p | tail -50
```

#### Mistake 3: Typing Commands in Already Active Sessions
**What Went Wrong**: Typed "claude" in a window that already had Claude running

**Root Cause**: Not checking window contents before sending commands

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check window contents first
tmux capture-pane -t session:window -S -100 -p
# Look for prompts or active sessions before sending commands
```

#### Mistake 4: Incorrect Message Sending to Claude Agents
**What Went Wrong**: Initially sent Enter key with the message text instead of as separate command

**Root Cause**: Using `tmux send-keys -t session:window "message" Enter` combines them

**Solution**:
```bash
# Send message and Enter separately
tmux send-keys -t session:window "Your message here"
tmux send-keys -t session:window Enter
```

## Best Practices for Tmux Orchestration

### Pre-Command Checks
1. **Verify Working Directory**
   ```bash
   tmux send-keys -t session:window "pwd" Enter
   tmux capture-pane -t session:window -p | tail -5
   ```

2. **Check Command Availability**
   ```bash
   tmux send-keys -t session:window "which command_name" Enter
   tmux capture-pane -t session:window -p | tail -5
   ```

3. **Check for Virtual Environments**
   ```bash
   tmux send-keys -t session:window "ls -la | grep -E 'venv|env|virtualenv'" Enter
   ```

### Window Creation Workflow
```bash
# 1. Create window with correct directory
tmux new-window -t session -n "descriptive-name" -c "/path/to/project"

# 2. Verify you're in the right place
tmux send-keys -t session:descriptive-name "pwd" Enter
sleep 1
tmux capture-pane -t session:descriptive-name -p | tail -3

# 3. Activate virtual environment if needed
tmux send-keys -t session:descriptive-name "source venv/bin/activate" Enter

# 4. Run your command
tmux send-keys -t session:descriptive-name "your-command" Enter

# 5. Verify it started correctly
sleep 3
tmux capture-pane -t session:descriptive-name -p | tail -20
```

### Debugging Failed Commands
When a command fails:
1. Capture full window output: `tmux capture-pane -t session:window -S -200 -p`
2. Check for common issues:
   - Wrong directory
   - Missing dependencies
   - Virtual environment not activated
   - Permission issues
   - Port already in use

### Communication with Claude Agents

#### 🎯 IMPORTANT: Always Use send-claude-message.sh Script

**DO NOT manually send messages with tmux send-keys anymore!** We have a dedicated script that handles all the timing and complexity for you.

#### Using send-claude-message.sh
```bash
# Basic usage - ALWAYS use this instead of manual tmux commands
./send-claude-message.sh <target> "message"

# Examples:
# Send to a window
./send-claude-message.sh session:3 "Hello Claude!"

# Send to a specific pane in split-screen
./send-claude-message.sh session:0.1 "Message to pane 1"

# Send complex instructions
./send-claude-message.sh backend:0 "Please check the database schema for the campaigns table and verify all columns are present"

# Send status update requests
./send-claude-message.sh frontend:2 "STATUS UPDATE: What's your current progress on the authentication implementation?"
```

#### Why Use the Script?
1. **Automatic timing**: Handles the critical 0.5s delay between message and Enter
2. **Simpler commands**: One line instead of three
3. **No timing mistakes**: Prevents the common error of Enter being sent too quickly
4. **Works everywhere**: Handles both windows and panes automatically
5. **Consistent messaging**: All agents receive messages the same way

#### Script Location and Usage
- **Location**: `./send-claude-message.sh` (in the orchestrator directory)
- **Permissions**: Already executable, ready to use
- **Arguments**: 
  - First: target (session:window or session:window.pane)
  - Second: message (can contain spaces, will be properly handled)

#### Common Messaging Patterns with the Script

##### 1. Starting Claude and Initial Briefing
```bash
# Start Claude first
tmux send-keys -t project:0 "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions" Enter
sleep 5

# Then use the script for the briefing
./send-claude-message.sh project:0 "You are responsible for the frontend codebase. Please start by analyzing the current project structure and identifying any immediate issues."
```

##### 2. Cross-Agent Coordination
```bash
# Ask frontend agent about API usage
./send-claude-message.sh frontend:0 "Which API endpoints are you currently using from the backend?"

# Share info with backend agent
./send-claude-message.sh backend:0 "Frontend is using /api/v1/campaigns and /api/v1/flows endpoints"
```

##### 3. Status Checks
```bash
# Quick status request
./send-claude-message.sh session:0 "Quick status update please"

# Detailed status request
./send-claude-message.sh session:0 "STATUS UPDATE: Please provide: 1) Completed tasks, 2) Current work, 3) Any blockers"
```

##### 4. Providing Assistance
```bash
# Share error information
./send-claude-message.sh session:0 "I see in your server window that port 3000 is already in use. Try port 3001 instead."

# Guide stuck agents
./send-claude-message.sh session:0 "The error you're seeing is because the virtual environment isn't activated. Run 'source venv/bin/activate' first."
```

#### OLD METHOD (DO NOT USE)
```bash
# ❌ DON'T DO THIS ANYMORE:
tmux send-keys -t session:window "message"
sleep 1
tmux send-keys -t session:window Enter

# ✅ DO THIS INSTEAD:
./send-claude-message.sh session:window "message"
```

#### Checking for Responses
After sending a message, check for the response:
```bash
# Send message
./send-claude-message.sh session:0 "What's your status?"

# Wait a bit for response
sleep 5

# Check what the agent said
tmux capture-pane -t session:0 -p | tail -50
```
